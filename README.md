COLAB: https://colab.research.google.com/github/rameshavinash94/Retail-Store-Analysis/blob/main/Project_Retail_store.ipynb

**Project Motivation**

**Clustering**: Customer segmentation and to get a better understanding of the group of customers who are at risk of churn so that retail stores can proactively engage with such customers to retain them.

**Classification**: Upon analyzing and segmenting the customers based on their buying pattern, we are classifying customers based on their total worth to a business over the whole period of their relationship (Customer Lifetime Value)

**Regression**: Predicting the product delivery date, a factor that influences the most to keep the customer satisfied.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains information of 100k orders placed in numerous Brazilian markets between 2016 and 2018. This is real business information that has been anonymized. Olist, the largest department store in Brazil, has generously shared this data collection. Olist connects small businesses from all around Brazil to the channel in a simple and cost-effective manner. The merchant can sell their products on the Olist Store and have them transported straight to customers through the Olist logistics partner. The vendor will be alerted to complete the order once the buyer has purchased the product from the Olist Store.When the client receives the product or the estimated delivery date approaches, the customer receives an email with a satisfaction survey where he or she can leave a note and some remarks on the purchase experience.
